           <h3>Payment & Attendance Policy</h3>
           <p><b>Tuition Policies</b><br>
                 + Tuition is a continuing charge for a monthly rated class or classes. <br>
                 + Tuition payments are due on the 8th day of each month.<br>
                 + Payments not received by the 12th of the month will incur a $15 late fee.<br>
                 + Registration/production fees and tuition payments are non-refundable and non-transferable after the start of the semester classes.<br>
                 + Tuition fees are based on the total number of instruction hours per semester (including dress rehearsals and performances) divided into 6 (fall) or 4 (spring) monthly payments. Regardless of how many classes are held per month, monthly tuition remains at a set rate.<br>
                + No tuition adjustments or credits are given for missed classes and no make-up classes will be offered, with the exception of studio-cancelled classes.<br>
                 + Classes for the semester end with the final show performance.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Production Fees</b><br>
             + All classes that have mid or end-or-semester stage performances are charged a one-time Production Fee. Production fees cover the licensing and royalties for plays and musicals, the acquisition, creation, and maintenance of costumes, sets, and props, scripts, and publicity. Production fees are due at the time of registration in order to reserve your child’s spot in a class.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Payment methods</b><br>
                 + Starting Fall 2021, all families must be set up for automatic tuition payments through invoices sent to them through SQUARE. ACH payment arrangements are preferred but debit or credit cards may be saved for auto-pay set up as well. Reminder notifications will be emailed on the 1st of each month an accounts will be charged on the 8th of each month.<br>
                 + Registration/Production fees are paid on our website through the online store. Other items such as Show Tickets,  promotional packages, and Seedling Credit or gift certificates are also available for purchase online. Front Row Seedling Seats must be purchased in person at our studio.<br>
                 + Manual Tuition Payments:  We accept Visa, Master Card, cash, check, and debit cards with a Visa or Master Card logo on them for payment at our studio.  A $25 fee will be charged for returned checks.<br>
                <br>
            <b>Withdrawal Policy</b><br>
                + Upon class enrollment, students are expected to complete the semester. Shows rely on the commitment of all cast members and participants to work together as a team. Fourteen (14) days written notice is required to discontinue any class. A withdrawal form must be filled out by the parent and submitted to the front desk in person. No refund of prior tuition payments will be issued and any past due payment must be made at the time of official withdrawal. Showcase Cast students are subject to the withdrawal policy outlined in the Cast Agreement. Your account will remain active, until withdrawal procedures have been followed.<br>
                <br>
             <b>Attendance/Tardiness</b><br>
                 + Consistent attendance is expected. In all our classes, the show rehearsals and educational elements are progressive, working off the previous week’s instruction.<br>
                 + If you know your child will be absent for a class, please give the teacher at least 2 weeks notice if possible. Please call the studio anytime your child is ill or unable to attend class. This is important in planning for rehearsals each week.<br>
                 + No tuition adjustments or credits are given for missed classes and no make-up classes will be offered.<br>
                 + Habitual absenteeism may result in a student’s role in a show being re-assigned to another student.<br>
                 + Classes will begin promptly at the scheduled time. Students are expected to be on time, in proper attire, and prepared for class. Students who are tardy miss important instruction and warm ups and disrupt the class.<br>
                 + Students are expected to take responsibility for learning missed instruction, choreography, directions and blocking and for obtaining any missed information, handouts, etc. We make every effort to post all choreography on our communication app, SLACK. Teachers are always willing to help if asked and classmates can be a great resource as well.<br>
